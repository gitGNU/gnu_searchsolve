===== README =====

SearchSolve has experimented with three different kinds of tests:
   * Each script with its own shell script
   * A "test runner" script that is generic
   * Autotest

At the moment, tests are being "transcribed" to use Autotest because
Autotest does what the hand-made scripts did and more.


--- RUNNING TESTS

Tests are run with either of these commands:

      ./testsuite
      make check


./testsuite should be used if arguments need to be specified. You can
color the output using sed.

      ./testsuite | sed -f color.sed
      make check | sed -f color.sed

--- WRITING TESTS

Tests go in the "suite" directory, one file per test. It should follow
this template (but you can add optional things):
