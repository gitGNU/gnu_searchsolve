We use two collaborative workflows:
   - Merge
   - Patch


=== MERGE

The merge workflow works by publishing your branch and sending an email to the
mailing list requesting a pull. The branch will be reviewed and if there are
any problems, you will get a reply asking you to fix them and email us again.

We will manually fix any trivial merge conflicts, but if there are non-trivial
merge conflicts, you will have to do a rebase or merge yourself and email us
again.

=== PATCH

Since not everyone has write access to the git repository, we cannot support
merge workflow with them. Before making a patch with git-format-patch, you must
make sure to rebase so that it is possibly to successfully apply the patch.

Make the patches and send them to our mailing list (see savannah).
If they do not merge successfully, you will get a reply asking you to rebase
and reformat your patches.
