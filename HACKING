We use two collaborative workflows:
   - Merge (official devs)
   - Patch (everyone else)


=== MERGE

The merge workflow is only for official devs since it requires write access
to the git repository. Collaboration is easier since merges are easier to
resolve than a patch.

It works by making a branch, switching to that branch, making changes,
switching to master, pulling from the main repository at savannah, and
then merging in your changes from the other branch.

Finally, you can push your changes to the upstream repository.

NOTE: If you are not an official dev this is possible if you publish your
repository in a place that an official dev can access. They will have to
do the merge step.


=== PATCH

Since not everyone has write access to the git repository, we cannot support
merge workflow with them. Before making a patch with git-format-patch, you must
make sure to rebase so that it is possibly to successfully apply the patch.

Make the patches and send them to our mailing list (see savannah).
If they do not merge successfully, you will get a reply asking you to rebase
and reformat your patches.
